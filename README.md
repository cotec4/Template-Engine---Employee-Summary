# Template-Engine---Employee-Summary

The goal of this assignment was to create a command line application where a manager is able to create a website with specific details about each of the manager's team members (engineers and  interns). This website provides the manager with quick access to all the relevant data for each of the employees (engineers nad interns).

This was a challenging assignment that required the use of Classes which we had recently learned and were challenging to implement. We also used Test-Driven Development, with the tests having already been provided for us making the development part of the test-driven development much easier.
